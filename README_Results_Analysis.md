# Results Analysis

In every portfolio which consists of three tickers, we analyze data of a 5 year span from 5/1/2018 to 5/1/2023, Monte Carlo Forecasting Tool is used to calculate cummulative returns with equally weighted, analyzed results are demonstrated as:
- Line plot 
- Probability distribution and confidence intervals
- Interactive plot
- Mean/median of simulated cummulative returns

In addition, using the lower and upper 95% confidence intervals, we calculate the range of possible outcomes of the initial investment, which 10,000 is used as an example in this project.

We also calculate what each portfolio would have returned today if the investment was made 5 years ago and the cumulative returns of 10,000 throughout 5 years is demonstrated as a line plot.
